# ExampleGPSTrainingReport

Interested in creating a Shiny app for your sport science work? Unsure how to get started? I have created a *very basic* Shiny app, that allows you to interact with and visualise sport science data. 
The example data used in the Shiny app is (dummy) global positioning system (GPS) data collected on (hypothetical) team-sport athletes, across different session types and 
dates. There are a number of (synthetic) variables in the dataset, that are presented via interactive visualisations and tables. You can view the app [by clicking here.](https://alicesweeting.shinyapps.io/ExampleTrainingReport/)

This *very basic* Shiny app serves as a way for you to get started in creating your own dashboard. You can replace the example data with you, edit the visualisations, 
re-format the table, change the application theme and add your own team/ club/ organisation logo... there are many aesthetic and technical things to change!
